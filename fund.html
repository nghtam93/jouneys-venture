            <p>Cyber Capital invests behind digital assets that address tangible use cases, generate economic benefits, demonstrate signs of product-market fit, and exhibit compelling crypto-economic models. We use fundamental analysis to select investments based on thorough due diligence, examining token valuation, technical protocol level research, on-chain data analytics, and active engagement with management and developer teams.</p>
            <p>We strive to keep the portfolio closely in line with the maturity and market attractiveness of each of these segments. Investments in every segment are diversified over one or more cryptocurrencies, depending on their relative strength and our expectation of them to eventually outperform the index. The fund is currently mostly invested in the protocol and network layers as we expect those to benefit most of the network effects, and because the application layer is still significantly less mature.</p>

                <div class="el__item__excerpt">
                  The security of the cryptocurrencies under management is one of our primary goals. To protect the large majority of the fund assets from unauthorized access, the cryptocurrencies that together account for up to 80% of the assets under management (AUM) (variances may occur due to value fluctuations) are held in cold storage with two out of three multi-signature. However, although continuous optimization of the security will remain paramount, we cannot be held responsible for the loss or theft of cryptocurrencies of the fund. Unless the loss or theft is caused by the gross negligence or wilful default on our part.

                <div class="el__item__excerpt">
                  Due to the relatively low overall market value, significant volatility and high unpredictability of cryptocurrencies, an investment in cryptocurrencies is considered a high-risk investment. Prospective participants should be aware that cryptocurrencies are subject to extreme market fluctuations and other risks inherent in investing in cryptocurrencies. The value of cryptocurrencies and the income derived from them may fall as well as rise and participants may not recover the original amount invested in the fund. Therefore, the fund is only suited for participants who can afford such a high level of risk.

                <div class="el__item__excerpt">
                  2% annual fixed fee for ongoing charges<br>
                  The ongoing charges figure (OCF) is the total yearly costs, including the management fee (except for profit share, transaction and redemption fees), The OCF is set as a fixed percentage of 2% over the assets under management (AUM) for the year concerned. The OCF is accrued weekly and charged monthly to the fund.<br>
                  20% annual profit share<br>
                  Cyber Capital is entitled to a profit share of 20% of the total gross yield (after deduction of the fixed fee) above the High Water Mark (HWM). The profit share is charged at the last transaction day of each year, or upon redemption of units<br>
                  2% redemption fee<br>
                  The 2% redemption fee is charged to discourage short-term, in-and-out trading of units and to compensate the fund for the possible negative effect of redemptions on the net asset value (NAV). The fee will be charged over the net redemption amount (after deduction of the fixed fee and the profit share) upon redemption of units. The redemption fee does not go to Cyber Capital, but is credited to the fund assets.

                  The NAV is determined each Wednesday at 13:00 UTC by the fund administrator IQEQ, based on the rates provided by Coin Market Cap. The incurred costs, as described in chapter 9 of the prospectus, will be taken into consideration for the determination of the NAV.

                  The fund will in principle issue and redeem units every Wednesday at 13:00 UTC, at the request of (prospective) participants, unless the NAV calculation is suspended or the prospectus provides otherwise. Requests for the issue and redemption of units need to be received by the administrator at least one calendar week prior to the intended transaction day. Only requests received before Wednesday 13:00 UTC will be executed the following Wednesday, based on the established NAV on that day at 13:00 UTC.

                  Although the portfolio consists of a large number of different types of cryptocurrencies, the majority of Fund A’s capital is allocated towards the portfolio top ten in terms of market capitalization. Compared to the smaller ones, these cryptocurrencies are all well established with more liquidity and can be considered more secure, stable and reliable. The fund also invests in the smaller less established cryptocurrencies, for which a strategy of multiple small positions is applied. Also known as the “unicorn” strategy.

                  The fund is an Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) and the fund manager is an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM). Both the fund and the fund manager are registered under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) registration/light regime with the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). This means that the fund manager is able to make use of an exception from the prospectus requirement, license requirement and full application of the AIFMD. Therefore, although the investment, the Fund and the Fund Manager are registered with the AFM, they fall outside the supervision of the AFM and the Dutch Central Bank (DNB). Pursuant to article 2:66a of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft), no licence and no prospectus are required for this activity.
